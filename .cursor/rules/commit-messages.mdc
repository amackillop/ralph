description: How to write good commit messages

 Follow the seven rules:

- Separate subject from body with blank line
- Limit subject to 50 characters (72 hard limit)
- Capitalize subject line
- No period at end of subject
- Use imperative mood in subject (e.g., "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug")
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Body explains what and why, not how
- The diff explains how

Subject test: "If applied, this commit will [subject]" must make sense.

Like how a comment provides important context for a line of code, the commit message
should provide important context for the change being committed.
