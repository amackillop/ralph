# Build Mode

Implement tasks for the current branch from `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## Instructions

1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and find the section for the current branch
2. Study `specs/*` for requirements
3. Pick ONE unchecked task from the current branch's task list
4. Search codebase before implementing (don't assume missing)
5. Implement completely — no placeholders or stubs
6. Run validation (tests, typecheck, lint)
7. Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: mark task complete, add learnings
8. Commit with descriptive message, push

## Current Branch

You are implementing tasks for: `{{BRANCH_NAME}}`

Only work on tasks listed under this branch in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## Rules

- ONE task per iteration. Complete it fully before moving on.
- Search before implementing. Code may already exist.
- Full implementations only. No placeholders, no stubs, no TODOs.
- If tests unrelated to your work fail, fix them.
- Keep `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` current with learnings.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` operational only (build commands, gotchas, style guidelines).
- If specs are inconsistent with implementation needs, update specs.
