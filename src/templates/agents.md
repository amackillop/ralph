# AGENTS.md - Operational Guide

This file contains operational information for building and running the project. Keep it brief and operational only - status updates and progress notes belong in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

## Build & Run

<!-- Add your project's build commands here -->

```bash
# Example:
# npm install
# npm run build
```

## Validation

Run these after implementing to get immediate feedback:

```bash
# Tests
# npm test

# Type checking
# npm run typecheck

# Linting
# npm run lint
```

## Operational Notes

<!-- Add learnings about how to run the project here -->
<!-- Example: "Use --legacy-peer-deps for npm install" -->

## Codebase Patterns

<!-- Add patterns that should be followed -->
<!-- Example: "All API handlers go in src/handlers/" -->
